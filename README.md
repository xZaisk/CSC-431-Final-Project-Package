### Individual Course Reflection

CSC431 gave me a solid introduction to real-world software development. I learned about software development life cycles, architecture, and agile methodologies. Working on the group project with Sebastian, Carlos, and Ethan was enjoyableâ€”everyone contributed equally, and we worked well together as a team. Overall, the course made me more confident in approaching software engineering projects.
