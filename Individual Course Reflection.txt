CSC431 gave me a solid introduction to real-world software development. I liked that we learned about software development life cycles, architecture, and agile methodologies. Working on the group project with Sebastian, Carlos, and Ethan on AGN-DB was enjoyableâ€”everyone contributed equally, and we worked well together as a team. I think that overall this course made me more confident in approaching software engineering projects.
